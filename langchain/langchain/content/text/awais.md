## 	Q1.Work: positive or negative?

In the right figure, we move the proton from point i to  point f in a uniform electric field directed as shown. Which  statement of the following is true?

1. A.Electric field does positive work on the proton; And Electric potential energy of the proton increases. 
2. B. Electric field does negative work on the proton; And Electric potential energy of the proton decreases. 
3. C. Our force does positive work on the proton; And Electric potential energy of the proton increases. 
4. D. Electric field does negative work on the proton; And Electric potential energy of the proton decreases. E. It changes in a way that cannot be determined.

Answer：c

process：

1. The direction of the electric field is to the right, and the force direction of the proton is the same as the direction of the electric field line. The proton moves in the opposite direction of the electric field line, the electric field does negative work, and the electric potential energy of the proton is enhanced.

## Q2: Work: positive or negative?

The right figure shows a family of equipotential surfaces associated  with the electric field due to some distribution of charges.  V1=100 V, V2=80 V, V3=60 V, V4=40 V. WI , WII, WIII and WIV are  the works done by the electric field on a charged particle q as the  particle moves from one end to the other. Which statement of the  following is not true?

1. $A. W_{I} = W_{II}$
2. $B. W_{III} is not equal to zero $$
3. $C. W_{II} equals to zero $$
4. $D. W_{III }= W_{IV }$
5. $E. W_{IV} is positive$

Answer: E

## Q3: Electric Field and Electric Potential

1. D,V=0,E=0
   1. process: At the midpoint of the line connecting two charges of one positive charge, the electric potential V is 0 because the point is on the equipotential surface of the two charges, and the electric field strength E is 0 because the point is at the zero point of the electric field. The closer to the midpoint of the line between the two charges, the greater the electric potential and the electric field strength, because the closer the distance, the higher the electric potential energy, and the greater the electric field strength.
